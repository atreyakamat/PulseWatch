📡 Project Documentation
Uptime Monitoring Dashboard
Project Codename

PulseWatch (you can rename later)

1️⃣ Project Overview

PulseWatch is a web-based uptime monitoring system that allows users to:

Add single or multiple website URLs

Configure custom monitoring frequency

Continuously check site availability via HTTP(S)

Log uptime/downtime events

Send email alerts on failures

View logs, uptime analytics & status history

Run continuously as a background service

2️⃣ Tech Stack
Frontend (Client)

Vue.js 3

Composition API

Pinia (state management)

Axios (API calls)

Chart.js / ECharts (analytics)

Tailwind CSS (UI)

Backend (Server)

Node.js

Express.js

Node-cron (scheduler)

Axios / node-fetch (HTTP checks)

Nodemailer (email alerts)

Prisma / Sequelize (ORM)

Database

PostgreSQL (recommended)

or MySQL (if preferred)

Infrastructure (Optional)

PM2 (process manager)

Docker (optional)

Redis (optional for queues / rate limits)

4️⃣ Core Features Breakdown
4.1 Website Management
Capabilities

Add single URL

Bulk add (comma-separated / newline-separated)

Edit / Pause / Delete monitors

Set check frequency (in minutes)

Website Model
Website {
  id: UUID
  name: string
  url: string
  frequency: number // in minutes
  isActive: boolean
  createdAt: Date
}

4.2 Monitoring Engine
How It Works

Uses node-cron to schedule checks

Each website has its own frequency

Sends HTTP GET request

Tracks:

Status code

Response time

Timeout

Errors

Health Check Logic
1. Send request
2. Measure response time
3. Check status (200–399 = UP)
4. If DOWN:
   - Log event
   - Trigger alert

4.3 Logging System
Log Model
UptimeLog {
  id: UUID
  websiteId: UUID
  status: "UP" | "DOWN"
  responseTime: number
  statusCode: number
  errorMessage: string | null
  checkedAt: Date
}

Stored Events

Every check (optional sampling)

All downtime events (mandatory)

4.4 Email Alert System
Alert Rules

Trigger email when:

Site goes DOWN

Optional: site comes back UP

Avoid spam using cooldown window

Email Config Model
AlertConfig {
  id: UUID
  email: string
  isEnabled: boolean
}

Email Content Example
Subject: 🚨 Website Down Alert

Website: https://example.com
Status: DOWN
Time: 2025-12-16 14:30 IST
Error: ECONNREFUSED

4.5 Analytics & Dashboard
Dashboard Metrics

Total websites monitored

Currently UP / DOWN

Uptime percentage (24h / 7d / 30d)

Average response time

Charts

Uptime over time

Downtime incidents count

Response time trends

5️⃣ API Design (Backend)
Base URL
/api

Website APIs
POST   /websites
POST   /websites/bulk
GET    /websites
PUT    /websites/:id
DELETE /websites/:id

Logs APIs
GET /logs?websiteId=&from=&to=

Analytics APIs
GET /analytics/uptime/:websiteId
GET /analytics/summary

Alerts APIs
POST /alerts/emails
GET  /alerts/emails

6️⃣ Database Schema (Simplified)
Website
------
id (PK)
name
url
frequency
is_active
created_at

UptimeLog
---------
id (PK)
website_id (FK)
status
response_time
status_code
error_message
checked_at

AlertEmail
----------
id (PK)
email
is_enabled

7️⃣ Background Scheduler Design
Approach

Load all active websites on startup

Create cron jobs dynamically

Restart-safe using DB state

Example Cron
cron.schedule(`*/${frequency} * * * *`, () => {
  checkWebsiteHealth(website)
})

8️⃣ Frontend UI Structure (Vue)
Pages

/dashboard

/websites

/logs

/analytics

/settings

Components

WebsiteTable

AddWebsiteModal

BulkAddModal

StatusBadge

UptimeChart

LogsTable

EmailSettings

9️⃣ Security & Reliability

URL validation

Timeout protection (e.g. 10s)

Retry logic

Rate limiting

Email alert throttling

Graceful failure handling

🔟 Deployment Strategy
Backend

Run via PM2

.env for secrets

Always-on monitoring

Frontend

Static build

Serve via Nginx / Vercel

🧠 MASTER PROMPT (Copy–Paste Ready)

Use this as your starting prompt for coding:

You are a senior full-stack engineer.

Build a full uptime monitoring dashboard called "PulseWatch".

Requirements:
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Frontend: Vue.js 3
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Use cron-based background jobs
- Allow adding single and bulk website URLs
- Allow setting monitoring frequency per site
- Periodically check website uptime via HTTP requests
- Log uptime/downtime events with response time and status code
- Send email alerts on downtime using Nodemailer
- Store logs and analytics in DB
- Frontend dashboard to show:
  - Website status
  - Uptime percentage
  - Logs
  - Charts
- Provide REST APIs
- Clean modular architecture
- Production-ready structure
- Use environment variables
- Error handling and logging included

Start with:
1. Backend folder structure
2. Database schema
